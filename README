ps3spu process module for IDA

credits: appreciate for Bluemimmosa for his code sharing and discussion.


just some quick notes:

- the plugin was developed using IDA 5.5, so if you have that it should
  compile out of the box.
- after compiling install the module in IDAs proc subdirectoy and also copy the dummy ps3spu.cfg file to cfg dir under ida

if you get a "Bad Logic" warning, please report!

note: there is no working loader for SPU self/elf files currently. you have to use readelf command to read out the
      section info of the SPU elf file, then load the none-zero sized program section manually.
